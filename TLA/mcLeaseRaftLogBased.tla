CONSTANTS MaxTerm, MaxLogLen, MaxClock

\* Used for model checking only.
StateConstraint ==
    /\ \A s \in Server :
        /\ currentTerm[s] <= MaxTerm
        /\ Len(log[s]) <= MaxLogLen
        /\ clock <= MaxClock

ServerAndKeySymmetry == Permutations(Server) \union Permutations(Key)

\* This is a "view". The model-checker considers two states equivalent if they
\* produce the same view. We reduce the state space by normalizing entries'
\* timestamps so the smallest time is always 0: e.g., [server1 |-> <<[term |->
\* 1, key |-> k1, index |-> 1, timestamp |-> 2]>>] is the same as [term |-> 1,
\* key |-> k1, index |-> 1, timestamp |-> 99], they are both normalized so the
\* timestamp is 0. Since the spec only cares about time differences, not
\* absolute time, it's safe to normalize times this way and it makes
\* model-checking practical. See Lamport, "Real-Time Model Checking is Really
\* Simple", 2005.
